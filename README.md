# code-snippets
Repo containing code snippets written for various platforms.
I've been procrastinating for a while to start this repo. I think it's a good time to start this ... better late than never! 
Idea is to give you a starting point when it comes to using Ansible, Azure or whatever is committed to my repo. 
If I reference other people's work, I'll make sure that I give them credit!
